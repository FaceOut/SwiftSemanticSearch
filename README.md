# USearch + SwiftUI: Dynamic Vector Search on iOS Maps

## Overview

This demo project illustrates how to build a dynamic, real-time search system on iOS using the __[USearch vector-search library](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch)__. In this example, we use 2-dimensional vectors—encoded as latitude and longitude—to find the closest Points of Interest (POIs) on a map. The search is based on the Haversine distance metric.

While this demo focuses on 2D vectors for geospatial search, the USearch library is primarily designed for higher-dimensional vectors. Combined with __[UForm AI models](https://github.com/unum-cloud/uform)__, it can power on-device, multi-lingual, and multi-modal __[Semantic Search applications](http://usearch-images.com)__.
