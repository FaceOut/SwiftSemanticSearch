#  Swift Semantic Search 🍏

This Swift demo app shows you how to build real-time native AI-powered apps for Apple devices using Unum's Swift libraries.
Under the hood, it uses [UForm](https://github.com/unum-cloud/uform) to understand and "embed" multimodal data, like images, multilingual texts, and 🔜 videos.
Once the embeddings are computed, it uses [USearch](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch) to provide real-time search over the semantic space.
That same engine also enables geo-spatial search over the coordinates of the images, and has been to shown to easily scale even to 100M+ entries on an iPhone 🍏
