# USearch + SwiftUI: Dynamic Vector Search on iOS Maps

## Overview

This demo project illustrates how to build a dynamic, real-time search system on iOS using the [USearch](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch) vector-search library. In this specific example, we use 2-dimensional vectors—encoded as latitude and longitude—to find the closest Points of Interest (POIs) on a map. The search is based on the Haversine distance metric.

While this demo focuses on 2D vectors for geospatial search, the USearch library is primarily designed for higher-dimensional vectors. When combined with UForm AI models, it can power on-device, multi-lingual, and multi-modal [Semantic Search applications](http://usearch-images.com).
